      A plain old data struct for holding various settings related to
      data flow analysis.

      Args:
        max_iterations: the maximum number of times to perform the graph
                        analysis step. A negative value means no maximum.
        bailout_seconds: break out of the analysis loop if the time spent
                         exceeds this value. Not a hard cap as subsequent
                         analysis steps are required, and at least one
                         iteration will always be performed. A negative value
                         means no maximum.
        remove_unreachable: upon completion of the analysis, if there are
                            blocks unreachable from the contract root, remove
                            them.
        die_on_empty_pop: raise an exception if an empty stack is popped.
        skip_stack_on_overflow: do not apply changes to exit stacks after a
                                symbolic overflow occurrs in their blocks.
        reinit_stacks: reinitialise all blocks' exit stacks to be empty.
        hook_up_stack_vars: after completing the analysis, propagate entry
                            stack values into blocks.
        hook_up_jumps: Connect any new edges that can be inferred after
                       performing the analysis.
        mutate_jumps: JUMPIs with known conditions become JUMPs (or are deleted)
        generate_throws: JUMP and JUMPI instructions with invalid destinations
                         become THROW and THROWIs
        mutate_blockwise: hook up stack vars and/or hook up jumps after each
                          block rather than after the whole analysis is
                          complete.
        clamp_large_stacks: if stacks start growing without bound, reduce the
                            stack size in order to hasten convergence.
        widen_variables: if any stack variable's number of possible values
                         exceeds a given threshold, widen its value to Top.
        widen_threshold: widen if the size of a given variable exceeds this
                         value.
      If we have already reached complete information about our stack CFG
      structure and stack states, we can use die_on_empty_pop and reinit_stacks
      to discover places where empty stack exceptions will be thrown.
